From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project was about deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it.

The skills needed were:
1. Moving a div around on the page
2. Sticking a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identifying the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grabbing the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Centering an element horizontally
6. Including CSS styles in a page
7. Using classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
